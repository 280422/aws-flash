73. As an application has increased in popularity, reports of performance issues have grown. the current configuration initiates scaling actions based on avg CPU utilization; however during reports of slowness, cloudwatch graphs have shown that avg CPU remains steady at 40 percent. this is well below the alarm threshold of 60 percent.Your developers have discovered that, due to  the unique design of the application,performance degradation occurs on an instance when it is processing more than 200 threads. What is the best way to ensure that your application scales to match the demands?

A launch two to six additional instances outside of the autoscaling group to handle the additional load.
